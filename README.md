  AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my step-by-step journey in learning Python, Data Science, and AI.
This repo contains my practice notebooks, scripts, and small projects as I grow from beginner to advanced AI developer.

  Goals

Strengthen my Python programming skills

Learn data analysis and visualization

Understand machine learning fundamentals

Build end-to-end AI projects
